          <p>Out of all the leading source development projects Drupal stands out as being a global phenomenon bringing together code and community in the web's leading multilingual web framework. Drupal is also a diverse community itself with leads for various initiatives spread out across the globe. NYC Camp is one of the half-dozen or so annual events bringing them together to collaborate in real time. This year 17 countries were represented by over 1000 registered attendees. Hosting on campus brings to the UN unrivaled access to not just some of the most knowledgeable Drupalists in the world, but also some of the most innovative thinkers in the area of open source technology and planning.

    <p>NYC Camp Training Day has the effect of creating or improving the skills of hundreds of information workers though teaching technologies such as Drupal, Symfony,  version control by some of the most in-demand Drupal trainers, in some cases flying in just for the day. All trainings were filled to maximum capacity, with extensive wait lists, indicating the tremendous hunger for this kind of Drupal / full stack training. </p>

    <h2 class="slide--title">The next generation of technology leaders</h2>
    <p>While many of the problems facing the world today are of immediate urgency, some of them won't be solved until the next generation– and then only if we give them a chance. Drupal NG is directed at providing the structure and resources these future young visionaries need to build innovative solutions to the problems they see through a different set of eyes. As young people quickly taking to new technology, they often take to it more quickly than adults working in the same area. They're just learning new skills to put to work, by getting started at such an early age they're really the tech visionaries of tomorrow

    <p>This year at NYC Camp an idea that the guest CIO happened to mention in her Saturday keynote caught the attention of developers in attendance, and a working prototype was completely by the day after the camp ended. This is an idea she has been trying to get off the ground for years, and she got more out of coming to NYC Camp than years of chasing down other avenues. Acting on a suggestion from keynote speaker Robin Chase only the day before, the Coding for a Cause" sprint on the last day of NYC Camp started building a working prototype for DOable, the climate change solutions project heretofore only imagined by her.

    <p>The success of the Drupal project worldwide, together in partnership with the UN's hosting of the well-established history of community organized annual events in New York City engender the possibility of "taking things to the next level" by attracting thinkers and visionaries who otherwise might have no opportunity to visit the UN. The success of series exemplified by TED Talks indicates the considerable demand for these kinds of visionary talks, and NYC Camp provides just such an opportunity to bring these deeply insightful and potentially world changing talks to the UN.  (Willy- please edit to note here how this is just one example that can lead to attracting increasingly visionary / high level speakers to the UN, and the potential to continue the conversation (CIO network) not just end with the  speaking engagement.
